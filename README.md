## Wiki:

Check the [wiki](https://github.com/Kyagara/crescent/wiki) for available commands and a lot more info!

---

## Installation:

You can either get artifacts from recent [workflows](https://github.com/Kyagara/crescent/actions), binaries from [releases](https://github.com/Kyagara/crescent/releases) or install using cargo (recommended):

```bash
cargo install crescent-cli
```

or

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/Kyagara/crescent
```

When installing crescent using cargo, default profiles will be created in crescent's main directory: `<home>/.crescent/`. Learn more about profiles [here](https://github.com/Kyagara/crescent/wiki/Profiles).

> Applications files, profiles and any important file is located in crescent's main directory.

## Todo

-   More tests, 85% target.
-   Attach/Log command watches the log file with the `notify` crate, it could use the application socket to receive new lines instead
-   Lots of unwraps inside threads
