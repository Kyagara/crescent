## OS support:

My main focus is Linux, crescent is built and tested on ubuntu `x86_64`, `aarch64`, `armv7` and `arm`. MacOs is not tested. Windows is not supported.

## Installation:

You can either get artifacts from recent [workflows](https://github.com/Kyagara/crescent/actions) or install using cargo:

```bash
cargo install crescent-cli
```

or

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/Kyagara/crescent
```

## Commands:

With `start` you can launch an application by passing the file path to your executable, optionally give it a custom name with `-n` (defaults to the file name), you can pass an `interpreter` with `-i`, for example, if you have a python project you can pass `-i python3`. Arguments can be added using `-a`.

> If you provide a `java` interpreter it will add a `-jar` argument automatically.

> If your arguments have spaces or `-` make sure to use quotes after `-a` like: `-a "-Xms10G -Xmx10G"`.

`list` the running applications.

`log` an application's `.log` file, you can specify the amount of `lines` with `-l` (defaults to 200). After printing the log, it will watch the file for any new lines added to it.

`send` a command to the provided application.

`attach` to an application, which let's you watch logs in realtime and send commands.

`kill` (SIGKILL), `stop` (SIGTERM) or `signal <int>` to send a signal to an application.

`status` prints information about an application.

> Log, PID and the application's socket are located in `/home/<user>/.crescent/apps/<app>`.

## Why?

I wanted to learn some Rust so I decided to create a tool similar to [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) and [mark2](https://github.com/mark2devel/mark2), these two tools saved me from a lot of headache when spinning up background services for apps and in the case of mark2, Minecraft servers.

## Should I use cres-

Not for anything in production, game servers for friends for example shouldn't be a problem. crescent does not currently support auto restarts in case of a crash or something equivalent to `pm2 save` to start apps on system startup.

## Todo

-   More tests, 85% codecov would be cool
-   Attach/Log command watches the log file with the `notify` crate, it could use the application socket to receive new lines instead
-   Lots of unwraps inside threads
-   Probably redesign the entire thing when I acquire more [knowledge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jksPhQhJRoc)
