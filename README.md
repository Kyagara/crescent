## Install:

When installing crescent using cargo, default profiles will be created in crescent's main directory: `$HOME/.crescent/`.

```bash
cargo install crescent-cli
## or
cargo install --git https://github.com/Kyagara/crescent
```

## Todo

Reimplementation of features already in `crescent`:

- Reimplement tests.
- Reimplement `kill` command.
- Rewrite `attach` command.
- Reimplement `stop_command` on `start` command and profile.

New features:

- Detection method for `init` systems and logging systems.
- Avoid recreating a service script if it already exists. Should have a `force` flag to override this.
- Add `enable`/`disable` service command.
- Add `delete` service/profile command.
- Finish implementing `Logger`, theres no logic of selecting a logging system and setting it for a service.
- Maybe use more enums on returns.
- Improve code, looks horrible.
